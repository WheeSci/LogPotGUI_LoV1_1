LogPotGUI_LoV1_1
================
The Processing (pde) files used to generate a GUI to control a low voltage potentiostat are presented.
All files must be in a folder named LogPotGUI_LoV1_1.  Opening the pde file LogPotGUI_LoV1_1 with Processing should opena all the other files as tabs.
The ControlP5 and gicentre.Utils libraries must be downloaded (Sketch>Import Library>Add Library).
The potentiostat incorporates a MSP430g2553 launchpad that is coded with Energia. You will also need the Energia files, which should be available from the WheeSci GitHub site.  Eagle files for building the potentiostat hardware should also be also be arround here somewhere.
The GUI was written for a potentiostat having current gain controlled by a selector switch and current offset controlled by a potentiometer.
